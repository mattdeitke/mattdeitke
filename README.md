### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

News:

- June 2022: I'm extremely excited about the release of [ProcTHOR](https://procthor.allenai.org)! It is our first attempt at massively scaling up training data for embodied AI, and we achieve pretty remarkable generalization results. If you have any questions, ideas, or thoughts, don't hesitate to email me :)
